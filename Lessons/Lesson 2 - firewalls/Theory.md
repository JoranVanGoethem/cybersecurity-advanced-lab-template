## To master
- In terms of the OSI model, what does a (regular, traditional) firewall do?

- Review the advantages and disadvantages of a host-based firewall vs a network-based firewall.

- What is meant by network segmentation and what are network/firewall zones?

- What is a DMZ? How can you build this with 1 firewall vs 2 firewalls? Are there advantages?

### Nmap:
- When scanning a TCP or UDP port with nmap, what is the difference between open, filtered and closed? How is nmap able to make this conclusion?

- Review cybersecurity and virtualisation: what is a banner grab and how do you do this using nmap?

### Systemd
- Where can you find the existing systemd configuration files on a Linux system with systemd?

- Review the following systemctl subcommands: systemctl cat ..., systemctl show ..., systemctl edit ..., systemctl list-units, systemctl list-unit-files and systemctl daemon-reload.

- How can you create your own systemd service? Note: you don't need to learn this out of the top of your head, but you should be able to interpret a given systemd unit file.

- What are systemd-timers?

### Proxy:
- What is a (forward) proxy?

- What is a reverse proxy?

- How are (reverse) proxies related to load balancers? Do you know software that can do both?
